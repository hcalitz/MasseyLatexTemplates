Latex Templates for Massey Institute of Fundamental Sciences

This repository presents LaTeX/XeTeX templates written for the 
Institte of Fundamental Sciences, 
Massey University, 
Palmerston North, 
New Zealand.

 1. Letters and memos(Communication)

The letter class provide options for signatures, two authors, and to add a phrase, 
e.g. "Confidential" in red.

 2. Presentations based on beamer (Presentation)

The presentation style sheet can be used with both LaTeX and XeLaTeX. 

It differs from the traditional beamer cookie cutter presentation by providing a 
"masseyBrand" command that can change the background, opacity of the background image, 
colour and logos at will between slides.

The blocks are also rewritten using tcolorbox, enabling images as backgrounds in blocks, 
better shadow effects and opacity of blocks. 

A circle clipped image with text extra command is provided.  

See the Presentation/IFSBeamerTemplateDemo.tex for an example of each feature.

Any comments, improvements and collaborations are welcomed.
