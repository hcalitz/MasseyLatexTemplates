	\hfill Seconded:  All
\item Matters Arising \\
	Review of Curriculum (Item 4.2)\\
	The report on the review of the degree has been released.  Its content is similar to that reported in the previous meeting.  The paper 115.101 is no longer a core paper but is still a requirement in some of the Flight Studiesâ€™ Majors.  This may result in a drop in student numbers of around 30\%.
